A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N41K5B65QJH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bike Race Free - Motorcycle Racing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12178.13991835405022744.6034fcc4-ac91-4c47-8e83-32c7f86e86ca.b58cd2ed-58ca-4fab-82d3-7c1e92ec5e37","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40339.13991835405022744.6034fcc4-ac91-4c47-8e83-32c7f86e86ca.430dcc73-83e0-4465-b2b5-716f98f8ed16","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12178.13991835405022744.6034fcc4-ac91-4c47-8e83-32c7f86e86ca.b58cd2ed-58ca-4fab-82d3-7c1e92ec5e37","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"68","PackageFamilyNames":["42632InstaRoyalSportGames.BikeRaceFree-MotorcycleR_8gdk6ypn1p9yp"],"ContentIds":["89a1b3bc-d84b-f8b9-3090-3375a260cb1d","ebf6c15f-7287-3d84-cda0-c5f4ebdb0938"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Bike Race Free is Top Motorcycle Racing Game!

Restore the balance between Light and Darkness! Build towers and traps using technologies of Orcs, Goblins and Necromancers.\r\nShow your tactical skills combining various towers' effects and using terrain features. Protect the stronghold of the Dark Forces from the onslaught of hostile armies of Light!\r\n\r\nNOTICE: If you have problems running the game please contact us (and please specify your device model): wp7.smartpixgames@gmail.com\r\nFAQ: http://www.smartpixgames.com/faq.php#p10\r\nPromo video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRz9-Zf0flk\r\n\r\nIn the full version of Myth Defense: Dark Forces:\r\n- 4 maps + random map in battle mode\r\n- campaign: 10 + 50 missions and 2 modes to pass it: Normal and Heroic\r\n- achievements, increasing amount of Glory Points for mission\r\n- different skills improvement \r\n- 22 types of towers and 3 types of traps in 3 technological branches (Orcs, Necromancers, Goblins)\r\n- special features of monsters and towers\r\n- runes to make towers stronger, and Alchemy to create runes\r\n- terrain features: difficult terrain, moving platforms, etc.\r\n- 40 levels of hardness. The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

New graphics! We will continue updating the game. Thank you for your support of independent game developers! \r\n\r\nUse your periscope to target and destroy enemy ships. Join our big submarine patrol team. Be on our submarine! \r\n\r\nLegend says: The year was 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic. The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here: http://pepper-games.com","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH402KQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tim the Fox -

The auto nudge will automatically offer the largest prize win available for the nudge amount and the reels you are on which is a real help to the player and ensures the player is offered the highest prize win possible for the circumstances and if collected, the auto nudge will also use the nudges and automatically nudge to the prize win offered).\r\n\r\n-Trial Jackpot Gold Run Repeater-(When the trail is on number twenty eight you will win the Jackpot and a random amount of steps on the Gold Run, which will repeat the Jackpot if you spin a successful Gold Run, so the more steps you have on the Gold Run, the more real the chance of a successful repeat).\r\n\r\n-Prize Win Gamble, Game Board Feature offer and Game Board Feature Shuffle-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine, you will be offered a prize win gamble, except in the case of Jackpot wins and you’ll be offered an exchange to a game board feature and you’ll be offered a game board feature shuffle.

Vince’s adventure takes him from the streets of New Orleans to the depths of a Louisiana bayou to find the whereabouts of his keeper, Madam Charmaine.\r\n\r\nIn true voodoo style, Vince encounters and defeats quirky monsters and villains ... by kicking his own butt! By racing under a falling safe, jumping into a high-speed blender, or leaping under falling rubble, Vince is sure to defeat his enemies—all while managing to escape completely unscathed.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n• Voodoo combat action: Players can employ more than 30 voodoo attacks that do outrageous things to Vince, but it's the monsters who end up hurting! Unlike in other games, players must actually USE dangers and hazards, instead of running from them. Falling safes, prickly pushpins, and bolts of lightning bring a whole new meaning to the phrase \"no pain, no gain.\" \r\n\r\n• Magical voodoo world: Thrust into the depths of a twisted and dangerous world, Vince must trek through 30 detailed levels, including crawfish-laden swamps, a graveyard filled with imps and lost zombies, a fantastic French Quarter, and a network of boggy sewers. \r\n\r\n• Vehicles and minigames: As the game unfolds, Vince must master and pilot a number of vehicles, including a fanboat, a submarine, an airplane—and even a rat gives him a lift at one point. Vince must master one mind-bending minigame after another to complete his quest. \r\n\r\n• Dynamic cast of characters: No adventure would be complete without its host of surly characters. Offbeat creatures with all the charm of New Orleans are around every corner. Vince encounters everything from Ginger Dead Men (who are not exactly sugar-coated) to a pair of intoxicated gas pumps that offer up a fiery challenge.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Play Anywhere: yours to play on both Xbox One and Windows 10 PC at no additional cost.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Live features including earning achievements and sharing game clips.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4SDHX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ludo King","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14699.13510798887568201.d35a80c9-5a29-4af6-8a17-beb5b111b8cc.71868e0f-6fba-42e1-90a4-303d0b944b52","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29503.13510798887568201.5c3c8d0b-c93d-4dfe-8da7-70cb3d0e0839.02491a69-ede2-41d5-a814-284590da4cf2","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31792.13510798887568201.3f457562-b9fc-4952-ac54-384846154690.8130aaa5-5254-40d6-a10e-e3a2cbcf2cfb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29547.13510798887568201.a38a07d9-22cd-45e6-87b5-735924d1e16e.8bfedba3-7068-4aab-b2f5-9d4af7128e10","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52586.13510798887568201.5200944e-0639-4e88-9df1-4054c4f752b2.802d0470-eee2-4a37-ad54-f39e4b6a6782","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4715.13510798887568201.c59f62d9-189b-478e-9f29-04eb87ce8282.74692947-82ee-4894-9941-d77cf72fe9aa","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21818.13510798887568201.b8bfb18c-08ea-4470-a2ad-51ba5cd944eb.eec9ff59-e33a-4924-bea4-57ecd57639ce","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52113.13510798887568201.780c7ec4-82b9-405b-ba32-590888fda87f.62c2c80d-2b17-4193-a156-224e11ef41b0","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57497.13510798887568201.8cc1a85f-42dd-4a3b-b001-6a0d42c1e4e5.4f4d6c57-0726-4ef5-aba7-83adcb8dfb9c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49463.13510798887568201.219c0670-0a18-418b-9ce1-f601a75c0745.2d5acda3-e25a-4e4f-a689-4feb4859d4ff","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.2,"RatingsCount":"26","PackageFamilyNames":["Gametion.LudoKing_d44gk3wcm1v88"],"ContentIds":["c94a8e79-c61c-8541-6d82-1528ae18cca0","219dd3b0-5fc6-40d8-6ad4-03623e736f90"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Ludo is board game played between friends, family & kids. Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NHQJB7P9B61","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ACA NEOGEO TOP PLAYER’S GOLF","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49933.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.f4f40d98-c592-4169-8afa-55936539592f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61958.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.89e317f3-227a-4dde-afd3-2d15127ba2bb","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27245.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.219645e6-e2f3-4c72-a977-a285c23844dd","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47576.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.bb31dfcb-47db-46e6-a88b-6a7db4ea6496","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47368.13620826150617954.4950ce59-2c20-47f3-879e-19d0fa7a0741.02614cf1-6d8a-425c-a168-bbf88a4e267f","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£6.09","Price":6.09,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["HAMSTERCorporation.ACANEOGEOTOPPLAYERSGOLF_7xd3265gdqs6r"],"ContentIds":["cd128cc9-16f0-3479-7613-29a4adc9f360"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"TOP PLAYER'S GOLF is a sports game released in 1990 by SNK.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards.

They understood, much better than any other people at that time - the art of economics. From their trading centers in the Baltic Sea, Birka and Haithabu they sailed the seas and developed extensive trade routes from Russia to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe game considers all aspects of Vikingism in a fantastic and realistic 3D world - trade, economics, and combat to a degree that may have been in the real life of a Viking.\r\n\r\nGoal is to build a robust economic system with a flourishing maritime trade under realistic climatic and seasonal conditions. Only with the income of your island production, the merchandising and the reward of fullfilled tasks - you’re able to fulfill the claims of your lord - Thorvaldson.\r\nBut apart from the harsh climate and other bad circumstances, the multitude of enemies are the biggest threat to your prosperity and your life. As a loyal swordsman of Thorvaldson, you will receive guard troops and can protect your village with massive weapons. Protection that you need to defend you properties and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOther information about the game:\r\nThe presentation of the figures, the calendar and the seasons, are largely based on historical traditions and geographical conditions. At the presentation of battle scenes, however, in order to increase the thrill, we have used a little bit of fantasy.\r\nThe in-game time of the game is divided so that 1 hour of real time means a day in-game. This results in a varied and long lasting playing time in which you can do your daily work.\r\n\r\nIn order to learn ongoing more about the details of the game, we recommend that you follow us on

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play.

This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his hunt for dangerous fugitives after a disastrous prison break.\r\n\r\nTACTICAL COMBAT\r\nUse the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, distractions, personal shields, proximity mines and more.\r\n\r\nSTEALTH\r\nChoose your approach with care. Some say running into the fray guns blazing isn’t always the best option. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use disguises and covers to sneak past irrelevant guards. Use silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers.\r\n\r\nLOAD-OUTS & GEAR\r\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon in each mission - and there’s something for everyone. Shotguns, handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbows, energy weapons, throwing axes and more.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P67VMK25XNV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Jumpy Horse Racing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3287.14624749049999261.d2a804b7-03a9-4999-9fbc-f5013eda9346.33d94084-1afb-4478-befc-3d2fc019ded9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45853.14624749049999261.24b3fd0a-ba16-440c-b681-b10ea468140a.45e2d0bc-2f42-457c-a292-bcc71865ed99","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29406.14624749049999261.ece0a5da-4c6c-4094-8854-5fe4c8c85e1c.306b6e6e-b63a-4074-9fb7-87f22d4abd21","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2053.14624749049999261.f0d52870-bb32-4d4b-8eb6-18246a58d92f.e146d7c4-9296-4f3b-a05b-ebb035de3ae9","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22306.14624749049999261.b0abab52-195e-4f1c-9adc-c49a9421e5f0.a0d4ef77-4d1f-48a8-b692-ec2e8543cb5a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4257.14624749049999261.45b84ba5-755d-4ea1-9dd5-9762779822a4.cccce645-f8a5-41a9-a492-ab2206e50f1f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46818.14624749049999261.4d05cdcb-c81a-438d-97d4-23c854e7992d.db29069b-d271-4840-8ced-3350633694b2","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64043.14624749049999261.7fcf04d1-d0dc-4911-8cb7-c329f0dab9d4.675a036c-e16c-46d3-85f1-902725a2f235","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30942.14624749049999261.a3515049-63dc-4d76-8362-9cf525a53248.d6d114f7-df2b-4376-bf9d-1f2f0753466f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£4.19","Price":4.19,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["InternetResheniaLLC.JumpyHorseRacing_33qpm2jgt4cdj"],"ContentIds":["b5ea05cf-b734-a987-407b-2a5d572dfa0a","ea9ad41d-3a49-d12c-f525-24f9fbec19fc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to Jumpy Horse Racing one of the best horse racing games out there.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P7LP202SQ8P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Crafting and Building 3D!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55031.14105217086464730.786e9dc0-b10a-4451-b830-5441bdd6e277.fbe6c574-e727-494c-b9a1-6c28c4a1097e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35093.14105217086464730.786e9dc0-b10a-4451-b830-5441bdd6e277.784700c1-2af0-4723-a234-a852bd9f36a3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Saor an-asgaidh","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["57673GlobalEntertainment.CraftingandBuilding3D_jysam6mhz54mr"],"ContentIds":["62466ac4-4bab-409c-780f-fcc23d1d34ab"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Crafting and Building 3D - Do you like building games?
